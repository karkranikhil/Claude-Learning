# Project: DataValidator - Python Data Validation Library

## Library Design Principles
- **API Design**: Simple, intuitive, and Pythonic
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies
- **Compatibility**: Python 3.8+ support
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and memory efficiency
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with examples

## Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `feature-[functionality]` or `fix-[issue-number]`
2. Write tests first (TDD approach)
3. Ensure 100% test coverage for new code
4. Update documentation and examples
5. Run full test suite across Python versions: `tox`
6. Update CHANGELOG.md with clear user-facing description

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow PEP 8 with line length limit of 88 characters
- Use type hints for all public APIs
- Docstrings required for all public functions/classes (Google style)
- Use dataclasses or Pydantic for structured data
- Implement proper error handling with custom exceptions

## Project Structure
- `/src/datavalidator/`: Main library code
- `/tests/`: Comprehensive test suite
- `/docs/`: Sphinx documentation
- `/examples/`: Usage examples and tutorials
- `/benchmarks/`: Performance testing scripts

## Testing Requirements
- Unit tests with pytest for all functionality
- Property-based testing with Hypothesis for edge cases
- Performance benchmarks for critical paths
- Integration tests with popular data libraries (pandas, numpy)
- Test matrix: Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12

## Documentation Standards
- README with quick start guide and installation
- API documentation generated from docstrings
- Tutorial notebooks for common use cases
- Performance guidelines and best practices
- Migration guides for major version changes

## Release Process
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Automated testing on multiple Python versions
- Code coverage reports and quality metrics
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- Automated PyPI releases via GitHub Actions

## Community Guidelines
- Welcome contributions with clear CONTRIBUTING.md
- Issue templates for bugs and feature requests
- Code of conduct for inclusive community
- Regular maintenance and dependency updates
- Responsive to community feedback and issues
