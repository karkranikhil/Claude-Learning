Remember the Balance
Claude.md gives Claude Code a specific target to hit while still allowing creative problem-solving within your constraints. It's your team's institutional knowledge distilled into essential, persistent context that makes every interaction more effective.

The goal is to scale your AI development labor by providing the right context at the right level - enough specificity to get what you want, but not so much constraint that it can't innovate within your boundaries.
