# Project: Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Platform

## Infrastructure as Code Standards
- **Primary Tool**: Terraform with HCL
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible playbooks
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes with Helm charts
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack

## Workflow Requirements
1. Create infrastructure branch: `infra-[environment]-[component]`
2. Run `terraform plan` and review changes carefully
3. Test in development environment first
4. Update documentation in `/docs/runbooks`
5. Peer review required for production changes
6. Use conventional commits with clear impact description

## Directory Structure
- `/terraform/[provider]/[environment]/`: Environment-specific configurations
- `/ansible/playbooks/`: Configuration management scripts
- `/k8s/[namespace]/`: Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- `/scripts/`: Automation and deployment scripts
- `/docs/`: Architecture decisions and runbooks

## Security and Compliance
- All secrets must use external secret management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit for all data stores
- Implement least-privilege access policies
- Use service accounts, never personal credentials in automation
- Maintain audit logs for all infrastructure changes

## Deployment Principles
- Use blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Implement automatic rollback on health check failures
- Tag all resources with environment, owner, and cost-center
- Use infrastructure modules for reusability across environments
- Implement proper backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up alerts for resource utilization > 80%
- Monitor certificate expiration dates
- Track deployment success/failure rates
- Implement SLA monitoring for critical services
- Use runbooks for common incident response procedures

## Cost Optimization
- Implement auto-scaling policies for dynamic workloads
- Use spot instances where appropriate for non-critical workloads
- Regular cost reviews with resource rightsizing
- Implement resource lifecycle policies for cleanup
